# Water Quality Analysis and Prediction

This project aims to analyze and predict the quality of water using real-world datasets with key physicochemical and biological indicators. It combines data preprocessing, threshold-based classification, and machine learning modeling for intelligent, proactive water quality management.

## üìä Dataset

Dataset is taken from : https://cd.epic.epd.gov.hk/EPICRIVER/marine/?lang=en

The dataset includes parameters such as:

Water quality parameters

-------------------------------------
5-day Biochemical Oxygen Demand (mg/L),Silica (mg/L),Chlorophyll-a Œºg/L,pH,Temperature (C),E. coli (cfu/100mL),Faecal Coliforms (cfu/100mL),Total Phosphorus (mg/L),Orthophosphate Phosphorus (mg/L),Volatile Suspended Solids (mg/L),Phaeo-pigments (Œºg/L),Suspended Solids (mg/L),Dissolved Oxygen Saturation (%),Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L),Salinity (psu),Secchi Disc Depth (M),Nitrite Nitrogen (mg/L),Nitrate Nitrogen (mg/L),Ammonia Nitrogen (mg/L),Total Nitrogen (mg/L),Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (mg/L),Total Inorganic Nitrogen (mg/L),Turbidity (NTU),Unionized Ammonia (mg/L)


With thresholds applied to assess water quality.

## üîç Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Normalize numerical features
   - Encode categorical variables

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize distributions and correlations
   - Identify potential outliers and anomalies

3. **Threshold Classification**
   - Label samples as 'Good' or 'Poor' based on provided water quality thresholds

4. **Model Building**
   - Train ML models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, Logistic regression, Stocastic Gradient Decient)
   - Evaluate using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

5. **Deployment Options**
   - Run locally using Python
   - Execute in Google Colab (if GPU/remote access required)
